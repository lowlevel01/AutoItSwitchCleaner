# AutoItSwitchCleaner
A handy tool I wrote to eliminate an obfuscation pattern I encounter very much in malware samples utilizing AutoIt scripts to prepare the next stage.

###### The Pattern in initializing some variables and then using a switch statement on one of them but only one case if valid and the loop exits afterwards rendering the other cases useless.
